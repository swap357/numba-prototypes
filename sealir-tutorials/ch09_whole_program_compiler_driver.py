# # Ch 9. Whole Program Compiler Driver
#
# ## About
#
# In this chapter we will focus on the development of a "Whole Program Compiler
# Driver". Essentially this is a high level part of a compiler which ties
# together the various low-level components developed in the previous chapters.
# Effectively we will seek to obtain command line program that can take a
# Python source module and compile the code within.
#
# Importantly there are two datastructures which will hold the necessary
# information to schedule compilation. The first is a [Symbol
# Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_table) and the second is a [Call
# Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph).
#
# The "Symbol Table" is a mapping structure that maps symbol names to symbol
# information. Concretely for the case of a Python function compiler, this will
# map functions to various pieces of information about these functions. In our
# case we consider classes to be syntactic sugar and we consider methods to be
# simply functions where the first argument (`self`) is an instance to a simple
# datastructre that has fields. In this case, the symbol information will
# consist of three parts:
#
#  * The fully qualified name of the function
#  * the complete `ast.AST` node for the function
#  * any calls that can be statically determined
#
# The "Call Graph" represents the relationships between functions. It is a
# directed graph where each node maps to a function and the children are the
# calls within the function. It represents the ordering of calls for a given
# function and thus can be used to schedule the compilation of functions. The
# call graph will be established from the third part of the symbol information.
#
# We develop these capabilities on the Python Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
# representation of Python. The module `ast` provides a set of utilities to
# work the AST. Specifically we will develop a visitor class by subclassing
# from the `NodeVisitor` class. This visitor will traverse the AST and collect
# the various pieces of information.


# ### Imports

import ast
import os
import pprint
import symtable
import sys
from collections import defaultdict
from dataclasses import dataclass

import IPython

from utils import IN_NOTEBOOK

# ### Symbol Information class


@dataclass
class SymbolInfo:
    name: str
    ast: ast.AST
    calls: list


# ### Call Graph Visitor class
#
# As mentioned above, `the CallGraphVisitor` class is a subclass of the
# `ast.NodeVisitor`. It is used to traverse the AST and collect information
# about the functions and their calls. Only a subset of the AST nodes are
# supported by `visit_*` methods. The most important ones are:
#
#   * `visit_FunctionDef`: Visit a function definition
#   * `visit_ClassDef`: Visit a class definition
#
# Additionally the function `update_calls` is used to rewrite the names such
# that they become qualified. The class itself has various housekeeping
# datastructures such as stack to keep track of the current namespace, which
# class is being visited and so on.
#
# Lastly, the function `get_call_graph` returns the call graph.

#
# The example shows the usage of the CallGraphVisitor class on the file
# [`llm.py`](./llm.py) which is a simplified inference engine for a large language model.
#
# As you can see we print out the symbol table and the global calls.

# ## Rendering the Call Graph with external tools.
#
# In this section of this tutorial chapter, we will use the package `networkx`
# to visualize the call graph.
#
# As you can see, there are two separate Call Graphs dervied from the top level
# calls in `llm.py`:
#
# * `TransformerLayer.__init__`
# * `TransformerLayer.forward`
#
# This information can then be used to compile the program. In this case
# however this is not yet sufficient, as you can see from the call graph there
# are calls to Numpy, a library who's source is outside of the module. Thus we
# must assume that these will be resolved at a later stage.
